[b]0.48beta[/b] (Apr 11, 2014)

[b]0.45beta[/b] (Apr 8, 2014)

*Detached Portraits at last! (Big thanks to Blazeflack).

*Added an option to make the non overlayed portraits transparent (detached or not).

[b]0.39beta[/b] (Mar 28, 2014)

*Reverted to Azilroka's skin file after his latest update in AddOnSkins (v2.15). A bit more fine tuning may needed.

*Removed the font.lua file. No need to force users to use BenikUI. On it's final release, BenikUI will have a seperate addon to override ElvUI name and damage font, to fit with BenikUI. What was added in 0.37b wasn't working as intended.

*Added option for the actionbars switch buttons. The user can now choose on which bar (1 or 2) the Switch buttons will show.
