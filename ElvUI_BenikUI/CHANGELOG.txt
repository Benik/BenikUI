[b]1.10[/b] (Sep 01, 2014)

*Added a new feature: Attach Castbar on the EmptyFrames. Credits: Blazeflack, with his permission, based in his addon ElvUI_CastBarPowerOverlay (http://www.tukui.org/addons/index.php?act=view&id=62).
*Moved all BenikUI Unitframe options from ElvUI Unitframes options, to their own tab.
*During the Install, the default ElvUI chat frame Loot/Trade is moved to the left chat panel, so that any Damage meter can sit freely on the right chat panel. If the chat frame is already renamed by the user, then it has to be moved manually.
*The last install step is now called "Addons". Amongst other things, it creates a Recount profile called "BenikUI" and adjust it's looks to fit with BenikUI. (AddOnSkins addon required).

*Minor fixes and adjustments.

*Removed the statusbars from buffs and debuffs. Wasn't working as intended.
*Added an option to hide player text values (health, power or any customText), when mouse over to show xp or rep bars. This is done to prevent rep or xp text overlapping health or power values in case the text is wide (usually with big rep names). Each value will hide if their y offset is < -10.

[b]0.48beta[/b] (Apr 11, 2014)

*Added an option to disable BenikUI chat datatexts. In order to show, default ElvUI chat datatexts must be disabled.

*Layout fix on hide/show chat datatexts.

*Added RareCoordinator in BenikUI style. Minor changes in S&L styling.

*Made BenikUI layout a seperate module.

*Different (more efficient) approach on hide/show chat datatexts.



[b]0.45beta[/b] (Apr 8, 2014)

*Fixed the detached portraits strata. They should now overlap the player and target frame.

*Fixed the xp/rep text format not changing cause were calling ElvUI's text format option. Added an option in BenikUI.

*BenikUI chat datatexts will hide when default ElvUI ones are shown. (needs a moar testing.. going to bed)

*BenikUI style in Shadow & Light edit.

*Detached Portraits at last! (Big thanks to Blazeflack).

*Added an option to make the non overlayed portraits transparent (detached or not).

*Removed the XP & Rep "Hide Text" option on the PlayerBar. Way too many checks with minimal result. Hiding the text can still be done in ElvUI General options.

*Applied a small fix for Skada style (Thanks Azilroka).

*Renamed the Mail datatext to BuiMail, so it doesn't conflict or show as duplicate, if another addon adds a similar datatext.

[b]0.39beta[/b] (Mar 28, 2014)

*Reverted to Azilroka's skin file after his latest update in AddOnSkins (v2.15). A bit more fine tuning may needed.

*Removed the font.lua file. No need to force users to use BenikUI. On it's final release, BenikUI will have a seperate addon to override ElvUI name and damage font, to fit with BenikUI. What was added in 0.37b wasn't working as intended.

*Added option for the actionbars switch buttons. The user can now choose on which bar (1 or 2) the Switch buttons will show.
