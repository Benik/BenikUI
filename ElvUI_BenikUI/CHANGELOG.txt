1.10 (Sep 01, 2014)

*Added a new feature: Attach Castbar on the EmptyFrames. Credits: Blazeflack, with his permission, based in his addon ElvUI_CastBarPowerOverlay (http://www.tukui.org/addons/index.php?act=view&id=62).
*Moved all BenikUI Unitframe options from ElvUI Unitframes options, to their own tab.
*During the Install, the default ElvUI chat frame Loot/Trade is moved to the left chat panel, so that any Damage meter can sit freely on the right chat panel. If the chat frame is already renamed by the user, then it has to be moved manually.
*The last install step is now called "Addons". Amongst other things, it creates a Recount profile called "BenikUI" and adjust it's looks to fit with BenikUI. (AddOnSkins addon required).

*Removed the statusbars from buffs and debuffs. Wasn't working as intended.
*Added an option to hide player text values (health, power or any customText), when mouse over to show xp or rep bars. This is done to prevent rep or xp text overlapping health or power values in case the text is wide (usually with big rep names). Each value will hide if their y offset is < -10.

0.48beta (Apr 11, 2014)

*Added an option to disable BenikUI chat datatexts. In order to show, default ElvUI chat datatexts must be disabled.

*Made BenikUI layout a seperate module.

*Different (more efficient) approach on hide/show chat datatexts.



0.45beta (Apr 8, 2014)

*Fixed the detached portraits strata. They should now overlap the player and target frame.

*BenikUI style in Shadow & Light edit.

*Detached Portraits at last! (Big thanks to Blazeflack).

*Added an option to make the non overlayed portraits transparent (detached or not).

*Applied a small fix for Skada style (Thanks Azilroka).

*Renamed the Mail datatext to BuiMail, so it doesn't conflict or show as duplicate, if another addon adds a similar datatext.

0.39beta (Mar 28, 2014)

*Reverted to Azilroka's skin file after his latest update in AddOnSkins (v2.15). A bit more fine tuning may needed.

*Removed the font.lua file. No need to force users to use BenikUI. On it's final release, BenikUI will have a seperate addon to override ElvUI name and damage font, to fit with BenikUI. What was added in 0.37b wasn't working as intended.

*Added option for the actionbars switch buttons. The user can now choose on which bar (1 or 2) the Switch buttons will show.

*Added style in WorldMap (needs testing for taints). The style applies only on small and quest map not on the big map.

*Fixed a visibility bug when the game menu and the bags were opened.
