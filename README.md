# BenikUI
BenikUI is an external ElvUI mod, adding different frame style and new features like detatched portraits, dashboards and many more, also available for WoW Classic and WotLK. 

All game versions require ElvUI v13.27+ installed.

Installation:

The installer will run the first time you enable the addon or after ElvUI install ends. You can run the installer anytime, by clicking the Install button in BenikUI options.
Any install step can be avoided, thus keeping your current settings.
All options are in light blue color inside ElvUI options; currently in actionbars, unitframes, player and target portraits.

Note:
BenikUI looks better with ThinBorder Theme enabled and 1920x1080 resolution.
