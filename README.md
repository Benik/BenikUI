Installation:

The installer will run the first time you enable the addon or after ElvUI install ends. You can run the installer anytime, by clicking the Install button in BenikUI options.
Any install step can be avoided, thus keeping your current settings.
All options are in light blue color inside ElvUI options; currently in actionbars, unitframes, player and target portraits.

Note:

BenikUI looks better with ThinBorder Theme enabled and 1920x1080 resolution.
